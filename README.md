# Machine Learning Algorithms in R
This repository contains a collection of R scripts for implementing and exploring various machine learning algorithms. The scripts cover a range of techniques from basic regression to complex models like decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. Each file corresponds to a specific machine learning technique or model.

## Files
The repository includes the following R scripts:

Decision_Tree.R: Implementation of decision tree algorithm.

Forecasting.R: Time series forecasting using various methods.

KNN.R: k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm implementation.

Naive_bayes.R: Naive Bayes classifier.

PCA.R: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

Random_Forest.R: Implementation of Random Forest algorithm.

SVM.R: Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.

Text_mining.R: Text mining techniques for analyzing textual data.

Arules_assignment.R: Implementing association rules for market basket analysis.

Logistic_Regression.R: Logistic Regression model for binary classification.

Multi-l-regression.R: Multiple Linear Regression for predicting continuous variables.

Neuralnet_NN.R: Neural network implementation using the nnet package.

Recomendation-sys.R: Building a recommendation system based on user preferences.

Simple_regression.R: Basic linear regression model.

## Installation
To run the scripts, ensure you have R installed on your system

## Usage
Each script is self-contained, meaning you can run them independently. To use any script:

Open the script in an R IDE or text editor.
Make sure your data is loaded properly (if needed). 
NOTE : Datasets are in Data-Science-Datasets Repository.
Run the script by executing each section, or run the entire script at once.
